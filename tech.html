                body, it was reduced to a skeleton, keeping only his afro intact. Brook drifted alone in the Florian Triangle for 50 years, eventually meeting

            <p>The Thousand Sunny is the second ship of the Straw Hat Pirates, built after the Going Merry was destroyed.
               It is often referred to as Sunny (サニー Sanī?) by the crew. It is a brigantine-type ship designed and built
               by Franky with help from Yokozuna, Iceburg, and the remaining Galley-La foremen who were among the best shipwrights
               in the world. Built from Adam Wood, it is a magnificent ship of the finest craftsmanship at least double the size of
               the Going Merry. Its features include practically all of the various requests the Straw Hats had before arriving in Water 7.
